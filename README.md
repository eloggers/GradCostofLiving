# Grad Student Cost of Living Analysis 

Using a data-driven approach, we summarized cost-of-living for graduate students in an Ecology Department. We presented the results to faculty to advocate for pay that reflected the cost of living in Bozeman, MT. We share these resources as a framework for others to follow to build finanicial equity among students. 

This workflow provides users with code to create a google form to collect cost of living data. The GoogleForm provides code to reproduce a survey using Google Forms and the EcologyStudentBudgets.Rpres file then produces a presentation based on the results of the survey. 

The two files were made to be run together. That is, if you change or add questions to the google form, you will also have to modify R presentation file. 

## To replicate the study: 
  1) Create a new Google Script File
       a. Open a new Google script editor (https://script.google.com/) OR go to Google forms, open a new form, click the 3 dots on the upper right and choose 'script editor'
  2) Copy and past the code from the GoogleForm file into the editor and rename the file from 'Untitled Project'
       a. Change any description fields you would like to change, specifically, the main form message. 
  3) Save the project (click the save button)
  4) Click the Run button
  5) Copy the URL in the execution box or navigate to your Google Forms page and find the form
  6) Distrbute the form to the students of interest
  7) Save responses from the form in a .csv file
  8) Open and run the EcologyStudentBudgets.Rpres with the associated file.

###

A minimum stipend amount is not automatically provided with these documents. We suggest reviewing your data and using the average necessary expenditures but also taking into account the median rental price for your location before coming up with a recommended stipend amount. Remember, students who fill out the form are probably already struggling to make ends meet. Just because they are paying $600/month for rent does not mean that they are living in a habitable environment (i.e. mold, noise, etc.). We found the MIT living wage calculator reflected similar pay suggestions to the amount we proposed as a comfortable stipend.

These documents were created by Elise Loggers and Parker Levinson in collaboration with Elisabeth Krieger, Lauren Gedlinske, and Nate Heili.   

##### The poster will be uploaded here upon completion of the ESA conference.
